# Fast-Food-Express
FastFood Express Android Application

During a regular busy day, most people realize there are just not enough hours in the day, so
every bit of time is precious. Of course one big part of people’s day is making sure that they have
a meal whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Some people choose to eat in but there’s plenty of
people who choose to go the fast-food route. As we can tell fast-food restaurants no longer seem
to be “fast food”. You find yourself waiting in long lines waiting for customers in front of you or
waiting for your food order. When people have busy days the time waiting for fast-food may
take time from important aspects of their day, so we decided to create an android application
called “Fast-food Express” to allow users to order their food, pay once they get there, and track
their movements so the food can get made within a certain radius.
From personal experience and opinions from others, we were able to see that fast-food
restaurants have become a problem. First customers go in there and get up to the register and
may or may not know what they want. Then customers have to go through the process of paying.
Finally customers have to wait for their food. If customers go the drive through route, it’s also
the same process just ordering from a car. When someone is behind multiple people who are
constantly repeating the same cycle then lines get longer and the wait for your food gets longer.
This can especially be hectic during peak hours like breakfast times or lunch times. If I’m a
person working somewhere and I have a one hour lunch break, once I decide to get some “fast
food” by the time I drive there, wait in the line, and eat my food, half if not all of my lunchbreak
is gone.

Our application will help relieve these issues not only for the customer, but for the restaurant
as well. First, the user of the application must sign up for an account by entering their name,
email address, and password. If the user already has an account the user may sign in with their
email address and password. If the user were to forget their password, the user will be able to
have their password sent to their email by entering in their email address. Once the user is
logged in with their correct email and password, the user will select a fast-food restaurant they
would like to order from, from a list of restaurants in the area. After they select the fast-food
restaurant, the user is able to view menu items of the restaurant and select items from the menu
to order and customize them (condiments, cheese, etc.). The user is then able to add the
customized/non-customized items to their cart and then gets an order summary for what they
ordered along with the customizable attributes. They are then able to pay for their order through
PayPal in the application. In order to pay through PayPal, the user must first login to their PayPal
account using their email address and password for their PayPal account. Once the user is logged
into their PayPal account with the correct email and password, the user is able to choose their
preferred method of payment. After the preferred method of payment is chosen, the user is sent
to their final order screen, to review then submit their order to the restaurant. Once the order is
submitted the application tracks the user and when the user’s gets within a certain distance of the
restaurant, the restaurant will begin making the user’s order. After the user completes their order,
the user then has the option to place another order at the confirmation screen.


Not only do customer’s sign into our application, but the restaurants are able to as well. Once
the restaurant has registered and logged in to the system, they are able to see the current order’s
that were sent to the restaurant by the customer’s. The restaurant will then be able to see all the
incoming orders. Through the tracking system, the restaurant will have a ticket printed when the
customer is within a certain distance so that there is a receipt system, as well as a notification
system for the restaurant to begin making the order.
Our application is a new innovative way to order food and a lot more efficient. The restaurant
will be able to decrease some of their lines from gaining users who use this application since the
customer will no longer have to order and pay through the workers physically. The customer will
also be able to save time because they are ordering from their location and paying through their
location and won’t have to worry about that when they get to the restaurant. They also will not
have to worry about waiting in lines as well as waiting for their food, since the restaurant will
begin making their order ahead of time according to a location that will make sure the food is hot
and fresh. This is a great application for all parties involved with fast-food and will has the
potential to become the future of fast-food. We want to ensure that at fast-food restaurants, fastfood
is “fast food”.
